In order to get this to run on westy (which is out of date)
I had to install another gcc via csw:
https://www.opencsw.org/manual/for-administrators/getting-started.html
https://www.opencsw.org/packages/gcc5core/

also had to modify functions.sh to assume that csw will cover it if the
expected version is not there.

And finally had to remove gcc ips dependencies from postgres104/build.sh
