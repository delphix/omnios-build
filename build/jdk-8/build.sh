# Special case for JDK 8 Update 60:
#   jre/lib/amd64/libt2k.so depends on jre/lib/amd64/libawt_xawt.so and
#   jre/lib/amd64/libawt_xawt.so has several X11 dependencies
#
# The JDK containes two implementations of the AWT library dependency
# (i.e., both libraries have the same external symbols):
#   jre/lib/amd64/libawt_xawt.so
#   jre/lib/amd64/libawt_headless.so
#
# For DxOS, libt2k.so should use libawt_headless.so instead of
# libawt_xawt.so since the later has X11 dependencies.
#
# The fix is to link libawt_headless.so into the file system namespace
# at the location LD will look for the libawt_xawt.so dependency.
#
# NOTE: This is corrected in JDK 8 Update 66. In that release,
# libt2k.so depends on libawt_headless.so
